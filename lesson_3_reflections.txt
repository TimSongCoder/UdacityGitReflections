When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You will want to use a remote repository if you work on your project from multiple computers,
or you and others are working on a shared project which needs one public repository to access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In some cases, the remote repository might add some changes which you do not
want to adopt. Pulling changes manually gives you most of the control on your
local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
Branches belong to repository, while forks and clones operates on repository.
Forks are repository cloning occurred exclusively in the context of GitHub, you
use fork on GitHub to clone someone other's repository to your profile.
Clones are merely meaning to clone a repository into a new directory, you typically
use clones to clone a repository from remote to your local machine.
You create new branches to introduce multiple versions within your repository.
