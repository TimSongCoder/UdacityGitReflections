What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository will create an empty repository for the working
directory to establish a version control system for it. And that's why you need
to do it, you need to create or initialize a Git repository manually on demand.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is much more like a temporary place for changes to be operated or
committed. It plays as the intermediate role between the working directory and
the repository and give you control about what contents from the working directory
can be version controlled into the repository.
